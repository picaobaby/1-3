# Day 5: Restaurant Menu

A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/jar36/pen/RMaYgy](https://codepen.io/jar36/pen/RMaYgy).

This challenge was to create a menu. Originally my idea was to have the menu content slide down when the image title was clicked. Although the functionality remains in the code, I chose to comment out the JS so that there would be conflicts when the pen was viewed on iOS.

I built this without any CSS frameworks.
