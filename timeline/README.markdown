# Timeline

A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/chriskevin/pen/ezjGh](https://codepen.io/chriskevin/pen/ezjGh).

A timeline featuring a vertical layout (and in the future also a horizontal). It is complete with progress indicators and milestone actions that can contain a title and free text. Content sections can be set to expandable and can be interacted with mouse as well as arrow and enter keys. Basic accessibility should be implemented although not yet tested.

CSS is written SMACSS style and powered by Sass. 
Javascript currently relies on jQuery.
