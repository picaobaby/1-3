# CSS Grid: Restaurant Website

A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/oliviale/pen/LYYrKMV](https://codepen.io/oliviale/pen/LYYrKMV).

Recently [tweeted](https://twitter.com/meowlivia_/status/1190662424300421120) that a restaurant website should have a text menu on the front page. Figured that if I can bitch about it on social media, the least I could do is to try and implement it too. 

... and it seems like if a tweet catches on, it's a great place to crowdsource UX requirements.
